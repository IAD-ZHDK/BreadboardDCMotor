# Breadboard friendly DC motor pcb mount
This is as simple PCB for mounting cheap mini geared dc motors (from DSD Motor) to a breadboard. 

There are a number of variations of the motors, with either 3 or 6 volts and with various gear ratios. Joy-it offers the motor together with a wheel and mounting parts.

This is intended for teaching Physical Computing or electronic basics. When two breakouts are used together with the Joy-it wheel combo, it's possible to turn the breadboard into a differential wheeled robot. This project was born out of the frustration of leads always breaking on mini DC motors during Physical Computing classes.

To assemle, simply snap off the vertical bracket, and solder together with the motor into place. An optional drop of glue, or a 3D printed bracket (files included) can secure the motor firmly in place.
